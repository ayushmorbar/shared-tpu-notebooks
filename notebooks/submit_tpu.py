"""Run code on a TPU chip from a CPU notebook.

This is the piece that makes the classroom affordable. The student's notebook has no
accelerator. When they call run(), this submits a Kubernetes Job that Kueue queues
against the shared v5e pool, waits for a chip, runs their code on it, and streams the
output back. The chip is held for the seconds the job runs, not for the hours the
notebook is open.

    import submit_tpu
    submit_tpu.run('''
        import jax, jax.numpy as jnp
        print(jax.devices())
        print(jnp.ones((4, 4)) @ jnp.ones((4, 4)))
    ''')

The notebook does not get its own TPU because GKE schedules one pod per TPU node, and
that pod uses every chip on the node. Two students cannot share a v5e chip. An attached
chip therefore holds a full node while the student reads the assignment. For 300
students that is 300 nodes. A queue turns the same class into a 32-chip pool.
