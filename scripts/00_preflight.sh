# Description: Preflight for a university TPU classroom. Read-only: nothing here costs money.
#
# Answers, per region, the three questions that gate a v5e classroom before
# capacity is ever in play:
#
#   1. Is v5litepod offered in the zone at all?
#   2. Does the project hold PodSlice quota there, and how much?
#   3. Is the region's TPU location list even visible to this project?
#
# The quota question is the one people get wrong. v5e has two quota families and
# only one of them matters:
#
#   TPU_LITE_DEVICE_V5    -> ct5l-  machine types. Almost always 0. GKE does not use it.
#   TPU_LITE_PODSLICE_V5  -> ct5lp- machine types. This is what GKE and the TPU API
#                            consume, including for a single chip (v5litepod-1 / 1x1).
#
# Asking support to raise Device quota when you needed PodSlice is a wasted round trip.
#
# Usage:
#   make preflight PROJECT=my-project-id
