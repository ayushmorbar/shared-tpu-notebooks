# Script: 01_spray_v5e.sh
# Description: v5e sibling of ai-infra-demo-2026-05/capacity/flex_spray_tpu.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN CALLING THAT SCRIPT
# ==============================================================================
# flex_spray_tpu.sh guards its flex zone list only when ACCEL=v6e-*:
#
#     if [[ "$MODE" == "flex" && "$ACCEL" == v6e-* ]]; then ZONES="${V6E_FLEX_ZONES}"
#
# A v5e flex run falls through to zone discovery, which returns every zone that
# offers v5e at all -- about 20 -- against a feature that exists in two. That is the
# same waste the v6e guard was written to prevent, just on a different chip.
#
# The v5e flex zone list, MEASURED by submitting a real FLEX_START request into each
# candidate on 2026-08-25. Only one zone accepted:
#
#     us-west4-a        accepted
#     us-central1-a     rejected, code 3, no flex pool
#     us-central1-b/c   v5e not offered at all, 0 accelerator types
#     europe-west4-b    rejected, code 3, no flex pool
#
# An earlier version of this file listed europe-west4-b as a flex zone, taken from the
# DWS Flex Dedicated table on an internal capacity dashboard, which showed 4/256 chips there. A
# real submit says otherwise. The dashboard reports pool SIZE, not whether your project
# can draw from it, and this is the second time that distinction has cost us -- the same
# trap produced a phantom 15,548-chip v6e pool in us-west1-c.
#
# Derive this list by submitting, not by reading a table. A rejection is instant and
# free, so the measurement costs nothing.
#
# us-central1 having no v5e flex pool is why a class running there waits on on-demand
# capacity and sees 20-minute cold starts.
#
#   MODE=flex     bash 01_spray_v5e.sh            # $0 while queued
#   MODE=ondemand ACCEL=v5litepod-1 bash 01_spray_v5e.sh

This proves the zone can serve v5e. The classroom itself runs on GKE, not on this
node -- the spray is here to pick the zone and to tell capacity failures apart from
configuration failures before a class of 300 hits it.
